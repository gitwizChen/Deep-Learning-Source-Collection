| TUTORIAL                                 | DESCRIPTION                              |

| **[Deep Learning SIMPLIFIED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLjJh1vlSEYgvGod9wWiydumYl8hOXixNu&v=b99UVkWzYTQ)** | Are you overwhelmed by overly-technical explanations of Deep Learning? If so, this series will bring you up to speed on this fast-growing field – without any of the math or code.<br>  Deep Learning is an important subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that connects various topics like Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Classification. The field has advanced significantly over the years due to the works of giants like Andrew Ng, Geoff Hinton, Yann LeCun, Adam Gibson, and Andrej Karpathy. Many companies have also invested heavily in Deep Learning and AI research - Google with DeepMind and its Driverless car, nVidia with CUDA and GPU computing, and recently Toyota with its new plan to allocate one billion dollars to AI research.<br>  You've probably looked up videos on YouTube and found that most of them contain too much math for a beginner. The few videos that promise to just present concepts are usually still too high level for someone getting started. Any videos that show complicated code just make these problems worse for the viewers.<br>   There’s nothing wrong with technical explanations, and to go far in this field you must understand them at some point. However, Deep Learning is a complex topic with a lot of information, so it can be difficult to know where to begin and what path to follow.<br>   The goal of this series is to give you a road map with enough detail that you’ll understand the important concepts, but not so much detail that you’ll feel overwhelmed. The hope is to further explain the concepts that you already know and bring to light the concepts that you need to know. In the end, you’ll be able to decide whether or not to invest additional time on this topic.<br>   So while the math and the code are important, you will see neither in this series. The focus is on the intuition behind Deep Learning – what it is, how to use it, who’s behind it, and why it’s important. You'll first get an overview of Deep Learning and a brief introduction of how to choose between different models. Then we'll see some use cases. After that, we’ll discuss various Deep Learning tools including important software libraries and platforms where you can build your own Deep Nets. |

| **[Tutorial: Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLSy5WlaWKc)** | Deep Learning allows computational models composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection, and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large datasets by using the back-propagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about dramatic improvements in processing images, video, speech and audio, while recurrent nets have shone on sequential data such as text and speech. Representation learning is a set of methods that allows a machine to be fed with raw data and to automatically discover the representations needed for detection or classification. Deep learning methods are representation learning methods with multiple levels of representation, obtained by composing simple but non-linear modules that each transform the representation at one level (starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level. This tutorial will introduce the fundamentals of deep learning, discuss applications, and close with challenges ahead. |
| **[Deep Learning with Neural Networks and TensorFlow Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYbVFhK_olY)** | Welcome to a new section in our Machine Learning Tutorial series: Deep Learning with Neural Networks and TensorFlow. The artificial neural network is a biologically-inspired methodology to conduct machine learning, intended to mimic your brain (a biological neural network).<br>  The Artificial Neural Network, which I will now just refer to as a neural network, is not a new concept. The idea has been around since the 1940's, and has had a few ups and downs, most notably when compared against the Support Vector Machine (SVM). For example, the Neural Network was popularized up until the mid 90s when it was shown that the SVM, using a new-to-the-public (the technique itself was thought up long before it was actually put to use) technique, the "Kernel Trick," was capable of working with non-linearly separable datasets. With this, the Support Vector Machine catapulted to the front again, leaving neural nets behind and mostly nothing interesting until about 2011, where Deep Neural Networks began to take hold and outperform the Support Vector Machine, using new techniques, huge dataset availability, and much more powerful computers. |
| **[Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks/home)** | Learn about artificial neural networks and how they're being used for machine learning, as applied to speech and object recognition, image segmentation, modeling language and human motion, etc. We'll emphasize both the basic algorithms and the practical tricks needed to get them to work well. This course contains the same content presented on Coursera beginning in 2013. It is not a continuation or update of the original course. It has been adapted for the new platform. Please be advised that the course is suited for an intermediate level learner - comfortable with calculus and with experience programming (Python). |
| **[Build a TensorFlow Image Classifier in 5 Min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfNvhPx5Px8&index=5&list=PL2-dafEMk2A7EEME489DsI468AB0wQsMV)** | In this episode we're going to train our own image classifier to detect Darth Vader images.<br>  The challenge for this episode is to create your own Image Classifier that would be a useful tool for scientists. Just post a clone of this repo that includes your retrained Inception Model (label it output_graph.pb). If it's too big for GitHub, just upload it to DropBox and post the link in your GitHub README. I'm going to judge all of them and the winner gets a shoutout from me in a future video, as well as a signed copy of my book 'Decentralized Applications'. |
| **[Build a Neural Net in 4 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL2-dafEMk2A5BoX3KyKu6ti5_Pytp91sk&v=h3l4qz76JhQ)** | Curious just how inspired neural networks are from brain architecture? Take some time to learn about the human brain! This is my favorite intro to neuroscience course. |
| **[Neural Network that Changes Everything - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py5byOOHZM8)** | Years of work down the drain, the convolutional neural network is a step change in image classification accuracy. Image Analyst Dr Mike Pound explains what it does. |
| **[Wide & Deep Learning with TensorFlow - Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmw9SWJ0L50)** | Wide & Deep Learning combines the power of memorization and generalization by jointly training wide linear models and deep neural networks. We've open-sourced the implementation with an easy-to-use API in TensorFlow. It's effective for generic large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs, such as recommender systems, search, ranking problems and more. We hope you find it useful in your machine learning projects. |
| **[Deep Learning - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l42lr8AlrHk)** | Google, Facebook & Amazon all use deep learning methods, but how does it work? Research Fellow & Deep Learning Expert Brais Martinez explains. |
